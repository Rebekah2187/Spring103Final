# Spring103Final "Chase"
Final for ENGR. 103H
My game "Chase" consists of an LED traveling around the LED's in a small circle, or "chasing."
Once the game starts, the player presses the button to make the moving LED pause on the LED number of choice (and it emits a small tone).
The goal of the game is to "stop" on each of the LEDs in a sequence. 
Ordinary sequence can be a simple "1, 2, 3, 4, etc." but can also be altered by player to increase to desired difficulty. 
Most accurate completion of the sequence wins.
